draw_cube function: This function takes a Tkinter canvas object, the initial x1 and y1 coordinates (for the front left top corner of the cube), 
and the size of the cube. The function calculates the vertices of the cube,
simulates the depth of the cube (as a 2D projection), and then draws the edges.
